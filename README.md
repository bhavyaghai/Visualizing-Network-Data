# Visualizing-Network-Data
This repository includes python code and data used for my poster presentation at IEEE Vis 2017 titled
"Visualization of Multivariate Data with Network Constraints using Multi-Objective Optimization"

We will upload the code & data shortly after our work is accepted in IEEE InfoVis 2017
